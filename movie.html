<h1>Nikita </h1>
<p1>This was produced by American TV series.
<br>
There was a division which belonged to the government for killing political foes.
<br>
However division was a fictional department,not known by the world.	
<br>
All the spies came from prison or had a complex background.
<br>
When they entired,division would fake their death certificate.
<br>
That's why people didn't knew them.
<br>
However,the heroine,Nikita,she rebel,fled and tried to defeat them.
<br>
After she went out there,she began destroying any of their horrible plan.
<br>
She also found a team.
<br>
She wanted to help more human!

<h2>喜歡的理由
<br>
在這部電視劇中,看到女主角用她的智慧和武力打敗敵人,令人崇拜!
<br>
那強而有力的拳擊絲毫不輸男生,細膩的心思更能讓她觀察到敵人的弱點。
<br>
總共有四季的內容,精彩又刺激的情節讓我忍不住一看再看,即使這部電視劇年代稍微久遠我仍然很喜歡。
